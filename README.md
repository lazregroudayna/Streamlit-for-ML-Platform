# AN END TO END SOLUTION TO AUTOMATE MACHINE LEARNING LIFE CYCLE
This Platform automatizes both DS and ML functionalities such as Data preparation, visualization, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.It is a user-friendly platform for both beginner data scientists with no prior deep technical background and professional data scientists with a good amount of expertise.

The main goal of this work is creating a platform that allows various Machine Learning and Data Science solutions. Besides, this platform involves the preparation of raw data, visualizations and gaining insights from data,  implementing multiple Machine Learning  models, evaluating the performance of these models using the appropriate metrics.
This platform automatizes the repetitive tasks of data scientists by addressing the challenges they face, minimizes the financial cost of these types of projects, and delivers an easy solution for non-technical users to implement their Machine Learning projects in a user-friendly interface. 
It empowers a broader audience to leverage the power of Data science.
